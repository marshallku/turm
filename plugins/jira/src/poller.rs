//! Background poller that publishes the four `jira.*` event kinds.
//!
//! Loop:
//! 1. Wait until the supervisor has sent `initialized` (so events
//!    don't leak before nestty has finished the handshake).
//! 2. First tick runs IMMEDIATELY (no leading sleep), then sleep
//!    `poll_interval` between subsequent ticks. Same posture as
//!    calendar's poller.
//! 3. If `fatal_error` is set OR neither env nor store has usable
//!    credentials, skip silently — the user can fix the env or run
//!    `nestty-plugin-jira auth` while nestty is already running and
//!    the next tick picks up the new state.
//! 4. Fetch ticket pages via `jira::search` (ORDER BY updated DESC,
//!    JQL: `(assignee = currentUser() OR watcher = currentUser()) AND
//!    updated > -<lookback>h[ AND project in (X, Y)]`), follow
//!    pagination via `next_start_at`, capped at MAX_PAGES.
//! 5. Diff each ticket against the prior `TicketSnapshot`:
//!    - **First sight** (snapshot is None): emit `jira.ticket_assigned`
//!      iff assigned to me right now. Do NOT emit `status_changed` —
//!      we have no `from` to report.
//!    - **Subsequent sight**: assignee changed → `jira.ticket_assigned`
//!      iff newly assigned to me. Status changed → `jira.status_changed`.
//!      Walk the inline `fields.comment.comments[]` and emit
//!      `jira.comment_added` per comment whose parsed `created`
//!      instant is strictly newer than the per-ticket watermark,
//!      plus `jira.mention` when the comment body mentions me.
//! 6. Save the new snapshot.
//! 7. Dedupe via a `HashSet<(key, kind, discriminator)>` so a transient
//!    re-publication can't fire twice. Cap at 4096; flush past cap.
//!
//! All errors are logged to stderr and swallowed; one bad poll tick
//! must not kill the daemon.
