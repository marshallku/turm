#!/usr/bin/env bash
# End-to-end verification of the Browser Workbench dispatcher gate on Linux
# (work unit B1c). Drives the REAL copad GTK app over its per-instance socket.
#
# What it asserts:
#   1. Every method registered-but-not-built answers `unsupported_capability`,
#      not `unknown_method` — the whole point of registering them.
#   2. A typo is NOT claimed by the gate. The gate must not swallow the
#      difference between "not built yet" and "no such method" (see step 2 for
#      why this is asserted negatively).
#   3. An UNPROTECTED pane behaves exactly as before: reads return page data and
#      a failed write still reports why. `redacts_write_result` is false without
#      protection, and a response shape that changed regardless of protection
#      would itself be a signal.
#   4. A `tab_id` that names a tab the pane does not hold answers `tab_closed`,
#      never a silent retarget onto the active tab.
#   5. A panel id that never existed still answers the handler's own `not_found`.
#      The delivery-time fail-closed is for a pane that vanished MID-FLIGHT; a
#      request that never had a target read nothing, and reporting `tab_closed`
#      for it would describe a pane closing that was never open.
#
# Not asserted here: the behaviour of a PROTECTED tab. `webview.tab.protect` is
# itself unimplemented on Linux (work unit B7d), so there is no way to enter the
# mode yet. The refusal paths it drives are unit-tested in copad-core; this
# script grows the protected cases in the unit that builds protection.
#
# Requires a display: copad is a GTK app and this runs it for real. It opens a
# window on the current session for a few seconds and then kills it.
