#!/usr/bin/env bash
# End-to-end verification of the comux control CLI's destructive verbs
# (`close-tab` / `kill-session`) against a REAL headless server.
#
# These can't be unit-tested: `App` owns live PTYs, so the only honest check is to
# drive an actual server over its control socket. The server runs on a throwaway
# socket AND a throwaway state file — without the latter it would restore (and then
# kill) the user's real sessions.
#
# Every request runs under a deadline on purpose: the first version of this script
# caught a wedged server (a pane whose shell outlived its SIGHUP blocked the
# single-writer loop inside `PaneTerm::drop`), and a hang is the exact regression
# worth failing on rather than waiting out.
#
# Steps:
#   1. headless server on an isolated socket/state
#   2. split → close reaps the pane; new-tab → close-tab reaps the tab
#   3. close-tab on a session's LAST tab is refused
#   4. new-session → kill-session <i> reaps it
#   5. kill-session on the LAST session is refused
#   6. a pane whose shell IGNORES SIGHUP is killed without wedging the server
#   7. a bad index is refused; `--json` with no index is a usage error (exit 2)
