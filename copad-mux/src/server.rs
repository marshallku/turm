//! The headless mux **server**: owns the [`App`] (authoritative `State` + PTYs),
//! binds the shared socket, serves both one-shot `ctl` requests and streaming client

//! terminal that launched them. Started implicitly by [`crate::client`] or explicitly
//! via `copad-mux server`.
//!
//! Ownership is atomic: a would-be server takes an exclusive `flock` on
//! `<runtime>/lock`; only the lock holder may unlink a stale socket + bind (no
//! TOCTOU race between competing starts). Same-uid peers only (`getpeereid`).

//! Multiple clients may attach at once (tmux-style shared view): the app is sized to

//! broadcast to every client (each diffed against its own baseline), and all share
//! input. Detach (`Ctrl-b d`) removes only the client that pressed it.
