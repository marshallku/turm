//! The mux [`App`]: the authoritative `State` (layout authority) + one `PaneTerm`
//! (real shell PTY) per terminal, plus the composition logic. It renders the whole
//! workspace into a `Buffer` ([`App::render_to`]) and interprets keys
//! ([`App::feed_key`]) — tmux-style prefix `Ctrl-b` then `%`/`"` split, `o`/arrows
//! focus, `x` close, `c`/`n`/`p`/`&` tabs, `d` detach; plus prefix-less
//! `Ctrl+Shift+arrow` nav and the `Ctrl-f` switcher.
//!
//! `App` is transport-agnostic: it owns no terminal I/O and no socket. The headless
//! [`crate::server`] drives it (render → ship cell diffs; forwarded keys → feed_key)
//! and the thin [`crate::client`] renders + forwards input, so the same App serves
//! local and detached/reattached sessions.
