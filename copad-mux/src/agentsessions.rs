//! Past agent conversations on disk — the data source behind the `Ctrl-b R` resume
//! picker (decision #99).
//!
//! [`agentstate`](crate::agentstate) answers "what is the agent in THIS pane doing"; this
//! module answers the opposite question: "which conversations exist that no pane is running
//! any more?" Both CLIs keep every transcript, so closing a pane never loses the session —
//! it only loses the id, and neither `claude --resume` (per-cwd) nor `codex resume` is
//! reachable from the mux. We enumerate the transcripts ourselves.
//!
//! - Claude: `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`. Records carry `cwd`, `timestamp`
//!   and `entrypoint`; the first `type: "user"` record whose `message.content` is a plain
//!   string is the prompt that started the conversation (its title). Subdirectories hold
//!   subagent transcripts and are skipped.
//! - Codex: `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl`. Line 1 is a
//!   `session_meta` record with `session_id` / `cwd` / `originator`; the first user prompt is
//!   much deeper (a multi-KB developer preamble precedes it).
//!
//! `~/.claude/history.jsonl` looks like a cheaper index and is NOT used: on the owner's
//! machine only 59 of its 223 session ids still have a transcript, and 638 transcripts are
//! absent from it entirely — it is a prompt log with its own retention, not a session index.
//!
//! Everything here is bounded: transcripts are unbounded append-only logs written by another
//! program, so every read is capped per file AND across the scan, only regular files are
//! opened (a symlinked FIFO would otherwise block the scanner thread forever), and the
//! scan itself always runs off the render loop (see [`spawn_scan`]).
