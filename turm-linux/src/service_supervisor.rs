//! Service plugin supervisor.
//!
//! A service plugin is a long-running subprocess that speaks newline-JSON
//! over stdio. This module owns the lifecycle (spawn, init handshake,
//! restart on crash), wires bidirectional RPC, forwards bus events the
//! service `subscribes` to, and registers `provides` actions through the
//! shared `ActionRegistry`.
//!
//! Conflict resolution. Before any process is spawned, every enabled
//! plugin's manifest is walked in lexical order of `[plugin].name`. The
//! first plugin to claim an action name wins; later plugins quietly skip
//! that one entry while keeping their other registrations. This makes the
//! global ownership table stable across runs and independent of spawn
//! ordering / filesystem mtime.
//!
//! Init validation. The runtime `initialize` reply is checked against the
//! manifest with the same asymmetric rule applied to BOTH `provides` and
//! `subscribes`: subset is OK (degraded mode — runtime can declare fewer
//! than the manifest), superset is rejected with a warning (extras
//! dropped, plugin keeps serving its manifest-approved set). The pre-spawn
//! analysis must stay accurate or the conflict resolution above is invalid.
//!
//! Threading. Each running service owns three OS threads: a writer that
//! drains the outgoing channel into child stdin, a reader that parses
//! child stdout and dispatches, and a stderr-tail thread that logs. One
//! additional forwarder thread per `subscribes` pattern bridges the bus
//! into the outgoing channel. All blocking happens off the GTK main
//! thread.
