/// macOS service plugin supervisor. Discovers manifests, spawns services
/// (eager or lazy depending on activation), runs the init handshake, registers
/// `provides[]` actions in `ActionRegistry`, routes `action.invoke` over
/// stdio, fans `event.publish` notifications onto `EventBus` so the trigger
/// engine sees them, sends `shutdown` on app quit.
///
/// Activation supported:
///
/// - `onStartup` (PR 3) — eager spawn at app launch. Required for plugins
///   that must publish events from boot (echo heartbeat, calendar poller).
/// - `onAction:<glob>` (PR 6a) — register placeholder handlers per
///   `provides[]`; spawn on first matching action call via `LazyEntry.ensure`.
///   Spawn runs off main thread so the 5s init-handshake ceiling can't
///   freeze the UI. Concurrent first-callers serialize behind the entry's
///   lock.
///
/// Still missing:
///
/// - **`onEvent:<glob>`** activation. Eager spawn defeats the point (plugin
///   should only run when matching events arrive); needs the trigger engine
///   to drive a "spawn on event match" path. Skipped with log today.
/// - **Restart-on-crash policy.** A crashed plugin stays dead for the
///   lifetime of this turm process. Hot-reload of the config doesn't
///   recreate `LazyEntry` either, so an entry in `.failed` stays failed.
/// - **Outbound `event.dispatch`.** Plugins that subscribe to bus events
///   (`subscribes = [...]`) don't yet receive forwarded events.
/// - **`provides[]` conflict resolution** across plugins.
/// - **Process-group ownership + signal handlers + crash-recovery PID
///   file** (codex I5). We rely today on stdin-EOF cascade + `shutdown`
///   notification + `process.terminate()`.
///
/// Threading model:
///
/// - `discoverAndStart` runs on `@MainActor` (called from AppDelegate).
/// - Each `PluginProcess` owns a dedicated reader thread that reads NDJSON
///   from stdout, looks up the response by id in a lock-protected pending
///   dict, and bounces the completion back to `DispatchQueue.main.async`.
/// - Stdin writes happen from the calling thread (main actor for action
///   dispatch, init handshake thread for the initial frame). `FileHandle.write`
///   is thread-safe per Apple docs and our writes are atomic per JSON
///   line so interleaving across threads is fine in practice.
