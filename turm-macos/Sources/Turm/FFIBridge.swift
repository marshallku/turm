// MARK: - TurmEngine (PR 5c)

/// Swift wrapper around the Rust `TriggerEngine` exposed via turm-ffi.
///
/// Lifecycle:
/// - `init()` creates the Rust engine + retains `self` so the C action
///   callback can safely cast `user_data` back to a TurmEngine instance.
/// - `setTriggers([...])` JSON-encodes and forwards. Hot-reload safe —
///   engine swaps the trigger list atomically.
/// - `dispatchEvent(kind:, payload:)` enters the engine; engine matches
///   triggers and fires the C callback synchronously for each match.
/// - `shutdown()` clears the callback slot, destroys the handle, releases
///   `self`. After shutdown the instance must NOT be used again.
///
/// Threading:
/// - `dispatchEvent` runs on the calling thread (main actor in our use).
///   The C action callback consequently fires inline on the main actor too,
///   which is fine because it just records into a thread-safe Swift slot
///   and dispatches to the registry asynchronously.
/// - We deliberately do NOT pin the engine to a serial DispatchQueue here:
///   the Rust `TriggerEngine` uses `RwLock` internally so concurrent
///   dispatches are safe; pin-to-serial would only be necessary if we
///   needed strict ordering between dispatch + setTriggers, which our
///   AppDelegate-only call sites don't.
/// Not `@MainActor` because EventBus.broadcast fires from any thread (plugin
/// reader threads forward `event.publish` from there). The Rust engine itself
/// is thread-safe (internal `RwLock`), so dispatching from any thread is fine
/// at the Rust layer; the C action callback hops into main actor before
/// touching `ActionRegistry`. `@unchecked Sendable` because the OpaquePointer
/// handle isn't Sendable per se but ownership stays single-instance.
