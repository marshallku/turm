/// On rename/delete the original fd becomes stale; the watcher automatically
/// reopens the file and installs a fresh source after a short delay.

/// asyncAfter closures both target the main queue, so all state access is serialised.
/// `@unchecked Sendable` silences the Swift 6 cross-actor sending diagnostic;
/// the single-queue invariant provides the actual safety guarantee.
